## Discussion

1. The scope of the Site To Cloud VPN, for example,  for API creation, should the endpoint of  Site To Cloud VPN be the cloud provider edge(PE) or the cloud virtual machine?  

   Huawei experts pointed that cloud PE is in the management scope of network controllers, while cloud virtual machine is the management scope of cloud management system, so cloud PE as the endpoint will be a easier way to complete the API.
